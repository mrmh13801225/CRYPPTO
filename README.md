## Projects

### CA1: Encryption and Digital Signatures

In this project, the following tasks were completed:

1. **Symmetric Encryption and Decryption**: Implemented using a sample message.
2. **Asymmetric Encryption and Decryption**: Applied to the same sample message.
3. **Digital Signature**: Added a digital signature to a message to ensure its authenticity and integrity.

### CA2: Bitcoin Transactions

This project consisted of two parts:

#### Part 1: Bitcoin Address Generation

1. **Generate Address**: Created a Bitcoin address on the testnet.
2. **Vanity Address**: Generated a vanity address with a specified pattern.

#### Part 2: Bitcoin Transaction Series

1. **Transaction Series 1**: 
    - Created a transaction with two outputs:
      - One output burned a specific amount.
      - The other output was claimable by anyone.
    - Claimed the claimable part for myself.

2. **Transaction Series 2**:
    - Generated three addresses.
    - Sent a transaction from my address to these three addresses as a 2-of-3 multisig account.
    - Created another transaction to send the amount back to my address using the multisig account.

3. **Transaction Series 3**:
    - Created a two-output transaction:
      - One output was claimable only if the recipient was over 18.
      - The other output was claimable if the recipient could provide a password.
    - Claimed the amounts in two separate transactions by:
      - Providing the password.
      - Proving that I was over 18.
